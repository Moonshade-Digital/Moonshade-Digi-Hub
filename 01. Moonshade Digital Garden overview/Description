Greetings fellow 'Moonshaders!'

If you're new to Moonshade Digital or Digital Gardens in general, this document should serve as a tertiary framework that lays out the essential guidelines needed to effectively navigate through this "digigar" or "Digital Garden." The "Atlas Of Ithonia" digigar began as a pet project to efficiently track the expansion of the Ithonia canon, Ithonia being a branching realm accessible through the "Interrealms" as seen in "Kass: Iridescent Akai."

The "Interrealms" plays a significant role in the "Obsidian Atlas," "Wandering Times In Akai: Todoke," "Lumin," & "Project Viras"
