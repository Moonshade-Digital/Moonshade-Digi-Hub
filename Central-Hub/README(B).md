Greetings MoonshadeDigi Team!

  This document will provide readers and team members with a map of Moonshade's 'Digital Garden' resources, which will act as a directory. 
As we expand our current projects and set out to break new ground the 'DIGIGAR'* will be the project that will receive the most consistent updates out of everything we currently have in development. 

Each 'DIGIGAR' or 'Digital Garden' will receive several years of development. "As of Q1 '25," The "Atlas of Ithonia" 'DIGIGAR' is the only digital garden offering currently available. This project will connect the "Kass: Iridescent Akai," "Project Viras," & "Lumin" IPs and canon. Our focus for 2025 will be the expansion of the "Atlas Of Ithonia" digigar with dossiers, mind maps, visual assets, concept work, apps, video games & more. We aim to provide our users with the most seamless and engaging experience possible as we rollout our new IP offerings. We want to provide our audience with the tools to define their experience with our content. As these projects expand, our worldbuilding content will be announced as developments become available. In Q2 of 2025, our discord will launch along with our crowdfunding campaigns. The discord will allow volunteers to assist in the development of the project, as such, each contribution will be rewarded with NFTs or crypto tokens that will increase in value with the growth of our projects.

### _1. Moonshade Digital Garden overview_

Greetings fellow 'Moonshaders!'

If you're new to Moonshade Digital or Digital Gardens in general, this document should serve as a tertiary framework that lays out the essential guidelines needed to effectively navigate through this "digigar" or "Digital Garden." 
The "Atlas Of Ithonia" digigar began as a pet project to efficiently track the expansion of the Ithonia canon, Ithonia being a branching realm accessible through the "Interrealms" as seen in "Kass: Iridescent Akai."

The "Interrealms" plays a significant role in the "Obsidian Atlas," "Wandering Times In Akai: Todoke," "Lumin," & "Project Viras"

## 5. Games

Moonshade has several titles that are currently in development "Lumin, Tales of Ithonia, Project: VS, & others TBA"
and will explore crowdfunding to gauge if that alone would be viable for a project of this scale. While all of Moonshade Digital's resources are devoted to the launch of our new IPs, key staff will occasionally rotate into new positions, which could lead to delays. As such, should this hinder development in any meaningful way, Moonshade Digital will consider partnering with a game developer/development studio to expedite the completion of project timelines.
As of Q4 2024 "Lumin" is set to be our flagship offering and will receive updates for our crowdfunding campaign early Q1 2025.

Our aim is for a closed alpha to be announced in Q3 2025, with a Beta testing phase shortly after late Q4 of 2025.
